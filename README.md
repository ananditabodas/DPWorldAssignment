### Steps

- Set up a Postgresql database and insert the coordinate data and ais data in it (sql/queries.sql).
- Find the dimensions for the bounding box using nearest neighbors and density estimation (code/bounding_box_analysis.ipynb)
- The NAIS website specifies the cargo vessel_type as any number between 70 and 79, inclusive. All AIS data is filtered to only contain these vessel_type codes.
- Write a function to take in the port code and output the unique number of cargo vessels by day (code/main.py).
- Analyse the traffic of vessels within the bounding box by hour of the day, across two days (code/temporal_analysis.ipynb).

# Installation Guide

- Create a directory to pull the code to:
`mkdir assignment`
- Change directory (assuming itâ€™s called assignment):
`cd assignment`
- Initialize an empty repository:
`git init`
- Clone the following repository by running the following command: 
`git clone https://github.com/ananditabodas/DPWorldAssignment.git`
- Create a .env file in the root directory and enter the following details:

```python
DB_NAME="dbname"
DB_USER="dbuser"
DB_PASSWORD="dbpassword"
DB_HOST="ipaddress"
DB_PORT= 5432
```

- Install all the packages required:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the code to get a date-wise number of cargo vessels (remove the spaces between the underscores): 
`python3 __ main__. py`

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Note: This repository doesnâ€™t contain any of the original CSV files. It assumes that a database set up is already present. If not, the queries within `sql/queries.sql` can be run using the `psql` command in Linux.

# Observations

The assumption is that there will be a larger concentration of vessels near the port. So the confines of the bounding box are defined with the help of a hexbin density plot. It results in a bounding box of dimensions:

- width in degrees- 0.035866
- height in degrees- 0.041723

Since vessels remain relatively stationary through the day, an hourly study of traffic seems like the appropriate resolution.

The total cargo vessels on 1st January, 2020 were 10 and on 2nd January, 2020 were 17.

Although there is a 70% rise in the traffic from the 1st of January, 2020 to the 2nd of January, 2020, it is a rise of 7 in absolute terms. Whether this is a spike or not cannot be determined without additional data about the average vessels received per day.

If we assume that there is a spike in the incoming vessels, these could be the reasons:

- 1st of January is a public holiday and could be a reason for fewer vessels entering the port.
- There may have been delays on the 1st of January due to poor weather conditions causing vessels to arrive on 2nd January instead.
